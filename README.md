Projekt na ZPI

This is an android cooking app with main fucntionality of 'reversed cookbook' which means that user put the ingrediends he has into app and he reveive photo-listed cooking propositions with recipe and all other information about specific dish. The layout should be changed because of using old technology and markups like ListView, GridView instead of RecyclerView which provide more reliability and scalability especially when changing screen orientation. I was responsible for design and implement whole views and agregate data to the views, adding functionalities like advanced searching - there was much more work to do but the sad thing is that I don't remeber what excactly. But I can explain how every single line of code is working : )

Edit: This folder does not contain whole project! You can find it at https://github.com/Radollos/ksiazka-kucharska
It should be organized, packaged, refactored to have it easier to maintenance and flexible.
Main branch is called 'klaudia' - there you can find everything!
